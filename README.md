# Graf

Graf is a crossed platform graphics library for Swift Programming Language. 

Graf was inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/), but not a clone. Graf will always be just a library.

Graf uses [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org) for drawing and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) for displaying and handling inputs.

Graf runs on MacOS and Linux. A port to iOS and Android in the pipeline.
